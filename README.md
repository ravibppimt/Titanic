# Titanic
Data Analysis and Machine Learning ~ Tutorial
#Kaggle Project #R #Matlab

This learning session is mainly based on Kaggle tutorial pages: http://trevorstephens.com/kaggle-titanic-tutorial/getting-started-with-r/
This tutorial also shows how a machine learning/data analysis problem can approached in different ways. Firstly focus on exploratory analysis of the data.I have also taken the idea of graphically exploring the data from : https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/titanic/exploring-survival-on-the-titanic . https://www.kaggle.com/jasonm/titanic/large-families-not-good-for-survival helped me in the analysis work of why large families in titanic were not good for survival.
All the sources are good places to learn feature engineering. Finally roll on to applying machine learning. http://trevorstephens.com/kaggle-titanic-tutorial/getting-started-with-r/ : source of applying decision trees and random forest to get better accuracy results.
